# Tensorstore Registry

This is an experimental bazel registry to prototype migrating tensorstore to use bazel modules.
Once ready, it is expected to include the complete set of tensorstore dependencies along with
sufficient metadata to build in bazel and CMake modes.

Expect that this repo could be destroyed at any time.
